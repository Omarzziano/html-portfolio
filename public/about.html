<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Omar Vel√°zquez Madrigal, I'm a primary care provider whos dream is to become a developer.
Since I was a little child I've always loved the videogames, growing up I started loving the technology around me, I was amazed by it, 
but along those likings, my family told me since a toddler that I would be a great doctor, and that I was going to make a lot of money in that career, 
constantly being said that. At the end, I enrolled in the health system but was never happy with it, it was not what I truly wanted, but I also wanted to prove them that I was capable of finishing the career, so I did.
</p>

<p>I started this new developer path, this new adventure because I love technology and I'm great at troubleshooting, so this are my first steps.
  I dont know where this will take me, I just know that I will enjoy every part of it and that anywhere where this takes me, I'll be happy.</p>
